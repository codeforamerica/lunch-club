# Lunch Club!

Lunch at Code for America is the best. Clubs are neat too, but only if they are open! Now **YOU** can join #lunchclub. Simply send information via Slack using the `/lunch` command and you'll be signed up to be a part of the gang for the day.

This is in a super early development phase, but we have a [roadmap of features](https://github.com/codeforamerica/lunch-club/issues/1). Feel free to add to it!

### Usage

`/lunch` command signs your username up and sends to the super awesome `<marquee>` at [radiant-atoll-7475.herokuapp.com/](http://radiant-atoll-7475.herokuapp.com/).
